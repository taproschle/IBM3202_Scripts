;NOTE: cut-offs should be longer if running a CA model than an AA model.
;3.0 nm is about 2.5 times the typical longest interaction in a CA model.
;Using a cutoff of 2.0 nm is completely reasonable as a 12A contact will have only
;~1% of its potential energy at that distance. We leave 3.0 nm here for safety, but
;if you know what you are doing feel free to decrease to 2.0 nm. If you have longer
;contacts, then of course increase these numbers.

;NOTE: tables are not currently supported with verlet lists, meaning that CA cannot scale 
;well with gromacs5. Usually this is not a problem since you only want to use 
;a single processor for small proteins. Note that -pd is not available in gromacs5 
;but instead openmp is used, but this is not available for cutoff-scheme group. 
;Basically, you should use gromacs4.6 for calpha, until tables are supported in 5
